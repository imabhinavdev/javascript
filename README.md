# Pig Game for 2 Players - Readme

## Introduction
This is a simple implementation of the Pig game for 2 players. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach a maximum score of 100. The game provides a user-friendly interface with a "New Game" button to start a new game at any time.

## How to Play

2. The game starts with Player 1's turn.
3. Player 1 rolls the dice by clicking the "Roll" button.
4. If Player 1 rolls a 1, their turn ends, and their score remains unchanged.
5. If Player 1 rolls a number from 2 to 6, the number is added to their turn total.
6. Player 1 can choose to either roll again by clicking the "Roll" button or hold their score by clicking the "Hold" button.
7. If Player 1 chooses to roll again and rolls a 1, their turn ends, and their turn total is reset to 0.
8. If Player 1 chooses to hold, their turn total is added to their overall score, and the turn passes to Player 2.
9. Steps 3-8 are repeated for Player 2.
10. The game continues alternating between players until one player reaches a score of 100 or more.
11. The player who reaches the maximum score first wins the game.

## New Game
At any point during the game, you can start a new game by clicking the "New Game" button. This will reset the scores and allow both players to start again.

## Technologies Used
The Pig Game for 2 Players project utilizes the following technologies:
- HTML: for the structure and layout of the game interface.
- CSS: for styling and visual presentation.
- JavaScript: for implementing the game logic and interactivity.
